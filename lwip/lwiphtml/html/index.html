<p> lwIP is an open source implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite
that was originally written by Adam Dunkels of the Swedish Institute
of Computer Science but now is being actively developed by a team of
developers distributed world-wide. Since it's release, lwIP has
spurred a lot of interest and has been ported to several platforms and
operating systems. lwIP can be used either with or without an
underlying OS.

<p>
The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce the RAM usage
while still having a full scale TCP. This makes lwIP suitable for use
in embedded systems with tens of kilobytes of free RAM and room for
around 40 kilobytes of code ROM.
</p>
    
<p>
lwIP features:
<ul>
<li>IP (Internet Protocol) including packet forwarding over multiple 
network interfaces 
<li>ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for network maintenance
and debugging
<li>UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for datagram data
<li>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) with congestion control, RTT
estimation and fast recovery/fast retransmit
<li>Specialized no-copy API for enhanced performance
<li>Optional Berkeley socket API
</ul>

<p>
lwIP is freely available (under a BSD-style license) in C source code
format and can be downloaded from the <a
