<li>The lwIP source archive contains documentation on how to port lwIP
and how to write applications using the native API. They can also be
found here: <a href="doc/sys_arch.txt">sys_arch.txt</a>, <a

<li>A report describing the design and implementation of an old
version of lwIP. The algorithms and data structures used both in the
protocol implementations and in the sub systems such as the memory and
buffer management systems are described. Also included in this report
is a reference manual for the lwIP sequential API and some code
examples of using lwIP. <a href="doc/lwip.pdf">PDF</a>, <a
